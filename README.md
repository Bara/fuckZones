# TF2007 (TF2 2007 Simulator)
---
  This gamemode is basically a plugin to bring back as much of the classic TF2 2007 as possible by disabling new taunts, new weapons and wearables. This plugin also sets some console variables as well to disable votes and allow for taunt weapon switching. This plugin also replaces your mapcycle file with a list of maps that were around in 2007.

* Default weapons only.
* No Wearables allowed. (including demo shields and sniper backs)
* Default taunts only.
* Disabled client-side voting.
* Taunt weapon switching enabled.
* Mapcycle.txt update to match. (disabled by default)
* ConVars to enable/disable everything.
* Airblasting disabled.
* Moving buildings disabled.
* Buffed Sticky damage.
* Disabled dropped weapons on spawn.
* Disabled all entity glow effects.
* Fixed Medic speed while healing Scouts.

Requires Sourcemod **1.8** or higher with **[TF2Items](https://builds.limetech.io/?p=tf2items "TF2Items")**.
